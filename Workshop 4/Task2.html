        <h1>Clash Royale</h1>
        <img src="Clash Royale.jpeg" alt="Clash Royale">
        <p>Clash Royale is a free-to-play real-time strategy video game developed and published by Supercell. The game combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena. The game was released globally on March 2, 2016. Clash Royale reached $1 billion in revenue in less than a year on the market. In three years, Clash Royale made $2.5 billion in revenue according to market intelligence company Sensor Tower. It is the first spinoff of Clash of Clans. 
            Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which puts players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win. After three minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns or none at all the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker, where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the least health is destroyed. If two towers have the same health, there is a draw.
            In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies. Players level up by gaining Experience points through donating and upgrading cards. King Tower levels can reach level 14, and player levels can reach level 50; these factor into the competitive match-making.
            Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles. A player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a rare draw).
            There are twenty-one playing arenas in total (excluding the Training Camp tutorial area): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, Barbarian Bowl, P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, Electro Valley, Spooky Town, Rascal's Hideout, Serenity Peak, Miner's Mine, Executioner's Kitchen, Royal Crypt, Silent Sanctuary, Dragon Spa, and Legendary Arena. Each arena corresponds to a certain trophy range.
            The original Legendary Arena represented the final arena following Serenity Peak, and it consisted of "Leagues", which were added to the game in March 2017. In the League system, players play through nine different leagues above 5000 trophies ranging from Challenger I to Ultimate Champion. At the end of each season, the player is reset to half of the trophies they gained above 5000 trophies. In the October 2022 update, this reset system was done away with in favor of a longer trophy road with more arenas, as well as a separate competitive gameplay mode that would follow a similar model as the Legendary Arena.
